# ellipsometry
In this project I wrote the code for analysis of elipsometric data (psi and delta). It finds optimal fit of parameters in an optical model of the sample using bounded non-linear fitting.

The scripts in this project use scientific computer libraries from open science platform Anaconda.
It can be downloaded here: https://www.continuum.io/downloads.

Package "lmfit" is used for bounded non-linear fitting.
More info about the package is available at https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/intro.html.
It can be installed using command line: "conda install -c conda-forge lmfit".
More info about "lmfit" installation can be found at https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/installation.html.

User should first try to run "Test fit from "lmfit" documentation - decaying sine wave.py".

For ellipsometry data analysis see "Two layer model.py" or Jupyter (formerly known as IPython) notebook "Two layer model.ipynb".
